This is a personal project that I started last year and have finally completed. It is a controller for KSP or similar simulators, although it can also be used for other games.

You can download the STL files here: https://makerworld.com/en/models/1157316-ksp-kerbal-space-program-controller-panel-joystick

You will need the following hardware:
  - Teensy 2.0++ or compatible board
  - 9x M3 inserts
  - 9x M3x10 countersunk screws
  - 2x JH-D400X-R4 joysticks
  - 16x mechanical switches cherry mx/gatheron style and the keycaps you like.
  - 2x EC11 encoders with push button
  - 2x MTS-203 three-pos switches

The code is entirely created with Claude 3.7 Sonnet, so it might contain errors.
You can use software like Joystick Gremlin and vJoy to fine-tune the behavior.
